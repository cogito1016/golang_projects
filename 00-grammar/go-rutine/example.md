Goroutines and Channels Basics:
- Create a program that uses two goroutines. The first one should generate numbers from 1 to 10 and send them to the second goroutine using a channel. The second goroutine should square the received numbers and print the squared results.

Producer-Consumer Problem:
- Implement a program with two goroutines - a producer and a consumer. The producer generates random numbers and sends them to the consumer through a channel. The consumer should calculate the square of the received number and print it. Ensure that the producer keeps generating numbers and the consumer keeps consuming them concurrently.

Parallel File Processing:
- Write a program that reads a list of file paths and processes them concurrently. Each file should be read, and the program should count the number of words in each file. Once all files are processed, print the total word count.

Concurrency with Worker Pools:
- Create a worker pool with a fixed number of worker goroutines. The program should take a list of tasks to be executed and distribute them among the worker goroutines. For example, you can use a worker pool to concurrently download a list of web pages.

Parallel Web Scraping:
- Build a web scraper that fetches data from multiple web pages concurrently. Use goroutines to send HTTP requests to different URLs and collect data. Be sure to handle errors and use a channel to collect and process the data from each request.

Concurrent Data Processing:
- Create a program that performs a complex data processing task on a large dataset. Split the dataset into chunks and process each chunk concurrently using goroutines. Ensure that you synchronize the results correctly to avoid data races.

Parallel Merge Sort:
- Implement a parallel merge sort algorithm using goroutines. Divide an array into smaller subarrays and sort them concurrently, and then merge the sorted subarrays to get the final sorted array.

Concurrency with Mutex:
- Build a program with multiple goroutines that access a shared data structure, such as a map. Use mutexes to protect the critical sections of your code to avoid data races.

Parallel Image Processing:
- Write a program that applies a filter or transformation to a collection of images concurrently. Load images, apply the transformation, and save the processed images in parallel.

Concurrent Web Server:
- Create a simple web server that handles multiple incoming HTTP requests concurrently using goroutines. You can use the standard net/http package to build your server.
